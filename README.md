# BloodCellsClassification
This project addresses a multi-class classification problem involving 96x96 RGB images of blood cells.
 The dataset contains eight distinct classes, each representing a specific blood cell type, such as basophils,
 neutrophils, and lymphocytes.
 Our approach started with a simple from-scratch model to establish a baseline. We then progressively
 advanced to transfer learning with fine-tuning, leveraging pre-trained networks to improve classification
 accuracy and efficiency.
